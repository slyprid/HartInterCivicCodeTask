## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

1. Write a simple program that implements a timer countdown on a web page. The front end
should be a web page (Angular preferred, but not required) that uses .Net web services API
for the following:
a. Retrieve the starting time from the web API as well as a short inventory list such as:
&lt;inventory&gt;
&lt;item&gt;&lt;Description&gt;Table&lt;/Description&gt;&lt;Count&gt;2&lt;/Count&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
&lt;item&gt;&lt;Description&gt;Chair&lt;/Description&gt;&lt;Count&gt;18&lt;/Count&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
&lt;inventory&gt;
To be written to disk
b. Conduct the countdown within the web browser, visually displaying the countdown
c. Call a second web API to indicate the timer is finished.
